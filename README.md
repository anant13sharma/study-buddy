> **⚠️ Note on Deployment**
>
> This project was originally deployed on **Heroku**, but as Heroku has discontinued its free tier, it is no longer hosted there.
> 
> If you're cloning or forking this project, I recommend deploying it on platforms that still offer free hosting for Django apps, such as:
>
> - **Render** (https://render.com)
> - **Railway** (https://railway.app)
>
> The project is fully compatible with both platforms.
